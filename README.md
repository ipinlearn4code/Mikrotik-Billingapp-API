MikroNet Billing API
MikroNet Billing API is a RESTful API built with CodeIgniter 4 to manage client subscriptions, invoices, and payments for an internet provider. This API integrates with the MikroTik API for managing PPP Secrets, allowing easy administration of users, subscriptions, and billing.

Subscription Management: Track client subscriptions with details about start/end dates and status.
Invoice Management: Automatically generate invoices 4 days before the subscription end date.
Payment Tracking: Monitor payment status, date, and method for each invoice.
Integration with MikroTik API: Manage PPP Secrets directly from the billing app.
Authorization: Uses token-based authentication for secure API access.
Technologies Used
CodeIgniter 4: PHP framework used for API development.
MikroTik API: For PPP Secret management.
MySQL: Database to store clients, subscriptions, invoices, and payment information.
JWT (optional): Simple token-based authorization for securing endpoints.

Additional Notes
Automatic Invoice Generation: Invoices are generated automatically 4 days before a subscriptionâ€™s end date. This feature can be run manually via the /invoices/generate endpoint or automated with a cron job.
Token-Based Authentication: Authorization headers must be included with requests to protected endpoints. Tokens are base64 encoded but do not use JWT for simplicity.
Future Enhancements
Implement JWT for more secure token handling.
Add roles and permissions for finer-grained access control.
Enhance error handling and logging for better maintainability.
